# Self_Assessment

This course has been amazing and learnt a lot. Started smoothly with excel but the course gradually got more challenging. 

Being a civil engineer, I never really liked coding and it has always been a regret since the job market is really good for people with data skills or IT skills.

I never thought I would be able to code in python but with the help of Instructor Jamie's help videoa, the TAs and the learning assistants I was able to successful complete most of my assignments. 

In the middle of the course, I had to go on a unplanned trip to India for about 2 months and it got more complicated because of the time difference and had to attend classes at 4 AM. But here I am, completed the project presentation and met the assignment requirement. 

I was glad we got to learn html and javascript too which I never expected is a popular tool in the data industry.

The most challenging topics for me was the MongoDB which I never was able to successfuly connect to and the next difficult one was the Big data since I did not have Microsoft excel tool on my computer I could not edit the csv file to successfully use. 

My most favourite I learned during the course was Jupyter lab and also the Tableau Dashboard. 

Also I enjoyed working with our project team, Antonio and Ming were great and helped a lot with the machine learning and the database part of our project. Eventhough our dataset was very limited we were able to achieve some useful insights regarding the yoututbe data and were able to analyse some category metrics. 

I like the class is online and accessible to people from different locations, time zones and is flexible to join from wherever we are. This helped me to travel even while taking the course. The 6 months has passed very quickly and I defnitely know more about data analytics and visualizations more now than before the course.
